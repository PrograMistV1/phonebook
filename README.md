Project "Phone Book":

Allows you to store contact information such as first name, last name, phone number and email address.

The program provides a simple text interface where the user enters commands to perform various operations.

Operations with contacts:
Creating a contact (create): The user can enter the details of a new contact, after which it is added to the phone book.
View contact list (list): Displays all contacts from the phone book with their serial numbers.
Editing a contact (edit): Allows the user to select a contact by number and make changes to its details.
Removing a contact (remove): The user specifies the contact number to be removed from the phone book.
Exit: Terminates the program.
Saving to file:

The program automatically saves contacts to the "contacts.dat" file when adding, editing or deleting contacts. (created automatically in the directory with the executable file)
When launched, the program loads contacts from this file, ensuring that the data is saved between different usage sessions.

Cross-platform:
The project takes into account the differences in screen clearing commands for Windows and Linux operating systems.

This project is a basic implementation that can be extended and improved depending on requirements and goals.
